i'm thinking of writing a package for bootstrapping. here are some of the current ones:

* https://github.com/pmbaumgartner/boots
* https://github.com/juliangehring/Bootstrap.jl
* https://github.com/christopherjenness/bootstrap
* https://github.com/dgerlanc/bootES
* https://github.com/ACCLAB/DABEST-python
* https://github.com/heolin/strapping
* https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.bootstrap.html
* https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.plotting.bootstrap_plot.html
* https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.utils.resample.html
* https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/boot/index.html
* https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bootstrap/index.html
* https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rsample/index.html
* https://github.com/facebookarchive/bootstrapped

at first i'll write it in c++ with no dependencies outside the standard library. i might add a python wrapper later.

this repository should be considered in an unusable state as of now and full of scratchwork.
